# Helping Hands - Reinventing Community Solidarity

In an age where technology dominates our lives, the sense of community in our neighborhoods has sadly diminished. It’s not uncommon today for people to not know the names of their neighbors, with greetings reduced to mere formalities. The Helping Hands project is born out of the necessity to revive that lost sense of community, reminiscent of the times of our parents and grandparents.

## Introduction

Helping Hands aims to recreate the cohesive and supportive neighborhood environment that once existed. A friendly neighbor can significantly simplify daily life, and that is precisely the objective of Helping Hands.

### About the App

Helping Hands is a web application designed to foster neighborly assistance and collaboration. Here’s how it works:

1. **Registration**: Users can sign up and create a profile.
2. **Posting Tasks**: Users can post requests for help with specific tasks, such as grocery shopping, pet sitting, or any other daily activities.
3. **Finding Tasks**: By entering their home address, users can view tasks nearby. This ensures that help is always close at hand.
4. **Choosing Tasks**: Users can select tasks that match their skills and preferences.
5. **Earning Coins**: Upon completing tasks, users earn symbolic coins. These coins incentivize helping others and can be used to post their own tasks.
6. **Community Feedback**: A review system ensures that the individuals offering help are trustworthy and competent.
7. **Leaderboard**: There is a leaderboard where you can see the most helpful people in the community, fostering a spirit of friendly competition and recognition.

### Vision

Our vision is to restore the neighborly spirit of mutual assistance and goodwill. In a world increasingly disconnected by technology, Helping Hands aims to bring people together, fostering a community where everyone looks out for one another.

### Conclusion

Helping Hands is more than just an app; it’s a movement to rekindle the sense of community and solidarity that seems to have faded in our modern world. Join us in making neighborhoods friendlier and more supportive places to live. Together, we can make a difference, one helping hand at a time.

## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://react.dev/learn)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) Tutorial (it doesn't assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-hooks-react-router/) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.\
We urge you to install the exact version **v20.11.0** which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/).\
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

- **MacOS:** [node-v20.11.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0.pkg)
- **Windows 32-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x86.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x86.msi)
- **Windows 64-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x64.msi)
- **Linux:** [node-v20.11.0.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0.tar.xz) (use this [installation guide](https://medium.com/@tgmarinho/how-to-install-node-js-via-binary-archive-on-linux-ab9bbe1dd0c2) if you are new to Linux)

If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

- **Homebrew:** `brew install node@20.11.0`
- **Chocolatey:** `choco install nodejs-lts --version=20.11.0`

After the installation, update the npm package manager to **10.4.0** by running ```npm install -g npm@10.4.0```\
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running ```node -v``` and ```npm --version```, which should give you **v20.11.0** and **10.4.0** respectively.\
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

```npm install```

Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).\
The client will send HTTP requests to the server which can be found [here](https://github.com/HASEL-UZH/sopra-fs24-template-server).\
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`\
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:\
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
